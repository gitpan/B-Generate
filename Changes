Revision history for Perl extension B::Generate.

0.06  Mon May 28 18:08:12 BST 2001
    - Backed out disastrous context compilation fix
    - Fixed B::LOGOP->new and B::LISTOP->new - it was creating binops and 
      blessing them as B::BINOP. Oops!
    - Added the undocumented "append_elem" method; this is enough for
      you to create subroutine calls if you know how. I should probably
      make a "gimme a sub call" utility function.

0.05  Wed Apr 18 08:50:33 2001
    - The bastards took op_children away!
    - Fixed interpret context compilation bug

0.04  Wed Mar 21 00:18:27 2001
    - Urgh. Fixed *nasty* segfault bug. (PL_op==0x0 after ->new)
    - Added "linklist" and undocumented "clean" method
    - Added "newstate" method
    - Documentation nits

0.03  Wed Jan 10 00:21:08 2001
    - Test script needed a fix to stop ->targ pointing into never-never
      land. Not *exactly* sure why.

0.02  Fri Jan  5 13:14:29 2001
    - Added a couple more methods and tests, mainly SVOP and SV methods.
